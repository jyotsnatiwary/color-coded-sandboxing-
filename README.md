# color-coded-sandboxing-

proposes to sandbox third-party libraries in Firefox by building a completely distinct software assigned to achieve the same task. The tool is basically a color distinguisher. It uses the netcraft rating and groups all the websites with same rating into one. Hence all the websites with same rating will show up the same color which will hence ease the user to differentiate.

The basic idea is to have such a software that makes the user aware about the malicious web pages and warn them. For example… all the web pages with the risk rating 0 will show green color on the toolbar. In the same way each rating will be assignd to a particular color.

The picture depicts that all the websites with same netcraft risk rating that is 0 shows the same color.

The risk rating of the website “bcebhagalpur.com” is 1. Hence it should display different color. All the websites with risk rating 1 should display the similar color.

Hence it can clearly be observed that the site with risk rating 1 shows up different color code.
