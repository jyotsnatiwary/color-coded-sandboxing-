# color-coded-sandboxing-

proposes to sandbox third-party libraries in Firefox by building a completely distinct software assigned to achieve the same task. The tool is basically a color distinguisher. It uses the netcraft rating and groups all the websites with same rating into one. Hence all the websites with same rating will show up the same color which will hence ease the user to differentiate.

The basic idea is to have such a software that makes the user aware about the malicious web pages and warn them. For example… all the web pages with the risk rating 0 will show green color on the toolbar. In the same way each rating will be assignd to a particular color.
